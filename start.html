            <p>There is no "standard" size as it depends on the resolution you wish to print at, so your calculations are correct.

Any discrepancy is due to rounding in the calculations where those performing the calculations rounded the intermediate values rather than waiting until the end (as you have done).

A one or two pixel difference across 5,000 pixels isn't going to be noticeable.

The most important thing to note is that 210 / 25.4 is only approximately 8.27. To more decimal places it's 8.2677165 - how many decimal places you take in this calculation will determine how accurate your result is.Ein bisschen Text</p>
